      "At least nine people were killed and 25 others injured after a powerful blast outside Pakistan’s famous Sufi shrine Data Darbar in Lahore. According to the BBC, the shrine was originally established as a simple grave next to the mosque which Hujwiri had built on the outskirts of Lahore in the 11th century. He is said to have lived on the site in the 11th century and was reputed to have miraculous powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sufi worshippers, who follow a mystical strain of Islam, have frequently been the target of bloody attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants -- including the Islamic State group -- who consider Sufi beliefs and rituals at the graves of Muslim saints as heresy. A blast at one of Pakistan's oldest and most popular Sufi shrines killed at least four people and wounded 24 in the eastern city of Lahore Wednesday, police said, as the country marks the fasting month of Ramadan. The shrine has been targeted previously -- a 2010 suicide attack there killed more than 40 people -- and is guarded by heavy security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lahore police chief Ghazanfar Ali said the bombing appeared to target police officers outside the shrine, known as Data Darbar, where Sufi saint Ali Hajveri is buried. Raja Basharat, a senior provincial minister in the Punjab government, said police were still trying to determine the nature of attack, which might have been a suicide bombing.\n"
